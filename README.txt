Welcome to the Blood Bank database!

I will be showing you the quick and easy steps on how to
set-up and get the database and webpage running.

Starting off with the install:

1.) Navigate to, and open your command prompt (CMD)
2.) Using the 'cd' command, do 'cd "your project directory"'
3.) Remove the "" if they appear then hit enter
4.) Then do 'npm install' and hit enter

Now that npm is set up, we can:

1.) Update the passwords in the 'connections_details' file 
to connect to the MySQL database
2.) Run the database code in your local instance
3.) Run 'cd' with your file directory but this time use 'npm start'
this begins to run the server
4.) Go to your browser and enter 'localhost:3000'

And just like that! You now have your Blood Bank website 
up and running!
